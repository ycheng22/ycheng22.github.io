Publications
======
* Jiang, M., He, H., Cheng, Y. and Su, W.P., 2018. Resolution dependence of an ab initio phasing method in protein X-ray crystallography. Crystals, 8(4), p.156.
* Two-step HIO method for direct phasing (in progress)

Work experience
======
* University of University: Research Assistant, May 2017 - Present
  * Developed Python code to retrieve phase of protein from X-ray data by iterative direct phasing method
  * Programmed script to run code on cluster, improved convergence rate by employing data weighting strategy
  * Extended this method to proteins with low solvent (<65%) by employing non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS)
  * Unveiled two total new proteinsâ€™ outline, started from the outline to retrieve phases

* Accenture: Research Intern, Mar 2016 - Jun 2016
  * Implemented risk-based power network security assessment, provided warning if security risk above threshold
  * Generated random load, applied Monte Carlo simulation to calculate power flow iteratively to get security index
