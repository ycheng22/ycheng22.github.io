Work experience
======
* University of University: Research Assistant, May 2017 - Present
  * Developed MATLAB code to solve phase problems using the iterative direct phasing method
  * Programmed script to run code on cluster, improved convergence rate by employing data weighting
  * Extended this method to proteins with low solvent (<65%) by employing non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS)

* Accenture: Research Intern, Mar 2016 - Jun 2016
  * Assisted manager to develop python code to simulate and assess system security risk
  * Applied Monte Carlo simulation and calculated power flow by PSS/E API iteratively to get security index
