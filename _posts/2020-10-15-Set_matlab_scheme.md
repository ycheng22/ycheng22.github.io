The package [MATLAB Schemer](https://github.com/scottclowe/matlab-schemer) makes it easy to change the color scheme of the MATLAB display and GUI.

You can use Schemer to import a predefined color scheme, transfer your color settings between installations, or create your own color scheme.

The personal scheme can be exported by `schemer_export.m`.
